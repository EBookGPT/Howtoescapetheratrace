However, it's worth noting that real estate investing does involve some technical aspects that require proficient coding skills. For instance, when acquiring a property, you may have to create financial models and conduct analysis to ensure that the investment meets your criteria.

One way to do this is by using spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. You can use these tools to analyze the potential cash flow for a rental property, calculate the property's ROI, or determine its net present value.
